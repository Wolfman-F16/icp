# Introduction #

This is a description on how to manufacture the electronics for the Hispapanel ICP


# Details #
This build requires skills in SMD soldering (down to 0603) and CNC machining

## Tools ##
The ICP protoype was built using the following tools
  * Solder Iron (medium tip and small tip for SMD parts)
  * CNC machine
  * Dremel(R)-like tool
  * standard toolset (screwdriver, file, glue, cutter, etc.)

## CNC Work ##
CNC machinig is required for
  * the lower transparent part of the Hispapanel ICP
  * transparent rocker parts of the Hispapanel ICP
  * ICP backplate PCB (Switches and backlighting is mounted here)
  * Wheel PCBs (those hold the ICP wheels)
  * DCS PCB (for the DCS 4-way switch)

## Soldering Work ##
The PCBs to be soldered are for
  * ICP electronics (holds buttons and connector to power and pc)
  * Rocker (for lower left rocker)
  * Switched power supply (for backlighting)

## Glue Work ##
The Hispapanel parts have to be glued. The transparent back to the ICP front and the ICP buttons.
